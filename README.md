# DATA-CLEANING
### Overview
This is a project concisely covering the basics of data cleaning in a sales dataset from café. The dirty café sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in the café. The cleaning and transformation process is essential to address errors and blanks, as well as inconsistent formatting and other data quality issues so as to remove unwarranted biases that might skew the analysis, and hence promote the reliability of the data, and inform business decisions for stakeholders of the café business.
### Data Source: Kaggle
### Tool Used: Excel
### Skills demonstrated: Data cleaning and data wrangling
### Data Cleaning
As mistakes could happen during the transformation process, copy of the data was made to have a reference of the raw data as a backup. 
After blanks were identified and appropriately filled, conditional formatting was utilized to aid easy visualization of duplicates and manipulation per column. The TRIM and PROPER functions were employed to remove extra spaces and consistently format the data. 
FIND and REPLACE was used to align the dates to a standard format. 
### Conclusions: 
Data cleaning is an important step because it ensures the accuracy, reliability, and effectivenes of the analysis. The cafe dirty dataset containined errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies that could lead to incorrect conclusions. The cleaning helped to remove inaccuracies and enhanced the data consistency as dataset collected from multiple sources had inconsistencies not limited to different date formats, even naming conventions. The cleaning standardized the data for uniformity, which will make making analysis smoother. Other functions of data cleaning and :
   - Handles missing values as such data can distort analysis (e.g., averages, trends).  
   - Cleaning also involves imputing or removing missing values to prevent bias.   
   - Cleaning identifies gaps and ensures all necessary fields are filled.  
   - Businesses rely on data-driven decisions; flawed data leads to poor strategies.  
   - Clean data ensures reliable insights for better decision-making. 
   - Fixing errors after analysis is more time-consuming and expensive. 
   - Proactive cleaning prevents rework and delays.    
   - Cleaning ensures data meets legal and organizational standards, thus facilitating regulatory compliance.
